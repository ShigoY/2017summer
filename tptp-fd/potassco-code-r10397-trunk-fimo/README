FIMO 0.2

FIMO is a system for computing finite models of first-order formulas. The input formulas
can be written in TPTP format. FIMO uses iClingo for finding answer sets of the resulting
logic program. An answer set represents a finite model of the input theory.

FIMO is written in Python. The input formulas can be written in TPTP format. E is used for
clausification.

After extracting the tar ball the system is ready for use. You can use it by running:
  
  $ ./fimo -nosplit -iclingo-opts '--heuristic=Vsids --iheuristic=keep' %s

where %s is the input file in TPTP format.

Dependencies:
-------------

python: >= 2.6.5

E (eprover):
  This is needed for clausification. The executable coming in this package is the 
  prebuilt E 1.3 Ringtong (64 bit) version downloaded directly from the E theorem prover webpage:
  http://www4.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/~schulz/E/E.html

TPTP2XML:
  This program is used for parsing TPTP problem files. This comes within the Geoff's SystemTools 
  package which can be downloaded from http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/ServiceTools.tgz. The 
  executable coming in this package is 64 bit compiled exe.

iClingo:
  iClingo is an incremental answer set solver. The executable coming in this package is version 
  3.0.80 (64 bit).
